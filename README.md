Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an intelligent routing mechanism that decides which AI model or agent should handle a given user query.

Instead of running a single large AI model for every request, MCP optimally selects specialized models or APIs based on the nature of the query. This improves efficiency, reduces computation costs, and enhances overall response accuracy.

ðŸ”¹ Key Components of MCP
User Query Processing â€“ The system understands user intent and determines the best AI agent to handle it.

Agent Selection â€“ MCP routes the query to the most suitable AI model or API (e.g., Google Maps for locations, Wikipedia for general knowledge).

Context Management â€“ MCP maintains the conversationâ€™s context, ensuring that follow-up questions receive relevant answers.

Response Generation â€“ The selected agent fetches data, processes it, and returns a human-readable response.
